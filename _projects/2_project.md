# Channel planform dynamics and the role of monsoon floods

We focused on the Bagmati River in central Nepal for this project.

We found a significant reduction in channel extent of the Bagmati river .

Average channel migration rate was between 2-40 m/yr.

We examined the changes before and after the monsoon season (inclusive) for each year and found larger variability in the channel extent change across the study reach.

We found strong correlation (r = 0.70) between accretion area and peak annual flow in the study reach, however erosion area was not adequately reflected from the hydrologic peak signals. Satellite flood map of an event in July, 2019 reveals the flood inundation re-visited the old channel extent.
