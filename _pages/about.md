<span style="font-size: 48px;">Hey, </span> <span style="font-size: 32px; ">you found me !</span>

<span style="font-size: 24px;">Hi, I am Nischal. </span>

I am a Water Resources Engineer from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYsm0l2Lht4">Kathmandu, Nepal</a>. I hold a master's degree in Water Resources Engineering from <a href="http://pcampus.edu.np">Tribhuvan University</a> and a bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering from <a href="https://ku.edu.np">Kathmandu University</a>, Nepal. I am currently working as a researcher at Centre for Disaster Studies (CDS), Institute of Engineering where I'm involved in few <a href="/projects/">projects</a> related to hydrologic and hydraulic modeling and fluvial hazard analysis using satellite remote sensing. 

<br>
I've often found myself reading about/ working on/ getting crazy project ideas on: <br> - Surface Hydrology <br> - Comparative / Large-Sample Hydrology <br> - Hydro-climatic extremes <br> - Fate of Water Resources under Climate Change <br> - Remote sensing <br> - Deep learning hydrology (Super-interested, have been following the domain intensively but haven't got the right opportunity to get my hands dirty, YET!)


<br>
In my spare time, I love to: <br>
<a href="/codes/">Code</a>, Learn data visualization, Play guitar, Travel, Cook
